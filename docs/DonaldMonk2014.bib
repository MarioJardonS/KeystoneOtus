abstract = {This book is concerned with cardinal number valued functions defined for
      any Boolean algebra. Examples of such functions are independence, which
      assigns to each Boolean algebra the supremum of the cardinalities of its
      free subalgebras, and cellularity, which gives the supremum of
      cardinalities of sets of pairwise disjoint elements. Twenty-one such
      functions are studied in detail, and many more in passing. The questions
      considered are the behaviour of these functions under algebraic operations
      such as products, free products, ultraproducts, and their relationships to
      one another.Assuming familiarity with only the basics of Boolean algebras
      and set theory, through simple infinite combinatorics and forcing, the
      book reviews current knowledge about these functions, giving complete
      proofs for most facts. A special feature of the book is the attention
      given to open problems, of which 185 are formulated.Based on Cardinal
      Functions on Boolean Algebras (1990) and Cardinal Invariants on Boolean
      Algebras (1996) by the same author, the present work is much larger than
      either of these. It contains solutions to many of the open problems of the
      earlier volumes. Among the new topics are continuum cardinals on Boolean
      algebras, with a lengthy treatment of the reaping number. Diagrams at the
      end of the book summarize the relationships between the functions for many
      important classes of Boolean algebras, including interval algebras, tree
      algebras and superatomic algebras.},
