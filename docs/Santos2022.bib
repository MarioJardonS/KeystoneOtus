abstract = {The $\backslash$textit{\{}nowhere dense ideal{\}} {\$}\backslashmathcal{\{}NC{\}}{\$} is introduced. It is a coanalytic ideal of {\$}\backslashomega\backslashtimes\backslashomega{\$} whose defining characteristic is that the sets of the form {\$}X\backslashtimes Y{\$}, where {\$}X,Y{\$} are infinite subsets of {\$}\backslashomega{\$}, are dense in the quotient {\$}\backslashmathcal{\{}P{\}}(\backslashomega\backslashtimes\backslashomega)\backslashslash\backslashmathcal{\{}NC{\}}{\$}. This quotient has countable partitions and consistently has partitions of size {\$}\backslashomega{\_}1{\$} while {\$}\backslashmathfrak{\{}a{\}}{\textgreater}\backslashomega{\_}1{\$}. This represents a huge contrast with other definable quotients. Other combinatorial features of this ideal are presented, as well as some results on a family of similar, higher dimensional ideals.},
