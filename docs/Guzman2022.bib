abstract = {Informally, a proper forcing P is strategically bounding if there is a strategy to prove that P is $\omega$ $\omega$-bounding. We prove that certain MAD families are indestructible by strategically bounding forcings. Our motivation for studying this topic is the problem of Roitman: Does d = $\omega$ 1 imply a = $\omega$ 1 ? From this work, it follows that a model of $\omega$ 1 = d {\textless} a cannot be obtained by forcing with a strategically bounding forcing over a model of CH. We prove an iteration theorem for strategically bounding forcings.},
