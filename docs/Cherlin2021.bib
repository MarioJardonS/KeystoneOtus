abstract = {We study Ramsey expansions of certain homogeneous 3-hypertournaments. We show that they exhibit an interesting behaviour and, in one case, they seem not to submit to current gold-standard methods for obtaining Ramsey expansions. This makes these examples very interesting from the point of view of structural Ramsey theory as there is a large demand for novel examples.},
