abstract = {We prove two {\$}\backslashmathrm{\{}ZFC{\}}{\$} inequalities between cardinal invariants. The first inequality involves cardinal invariants associated with an analytic P-ideal, in particular the ideal of subsets of {\$}\backslashomega{\$} of asymptotic density {\$}0{\$}. We obtain an upper bound on the {\$}\backslashast{\$}-covering number, sometimes also called the weak covering number, of this ideal by proving in Section $\backslash$ref{\{}sec:covz0{\}} that {\$}{\{}\backslashmathord{\{}\backslashmathrm{\{}cov{\}}{\}}{\}}{\^{}}{\{}\backslashast{\}}({\{}\backslashmathcal{\{}Z{\}}{\}}{\_}{\{}0{\}}) \backslashleq \backslashmathfrak{\{}d{\}}{\$}. In Section $\backslash$ref{\{}sec:skbk{\}} we investigate the relationship between the bounding and splitting numbers at regular uncountable cardinals. We prove in sharp contrast to the case when {\$}\backslashkappa = \backslashomega{\$}, that if {\$}\backslashkappa{\$} is any regular uncountable cardinal, then {\$}{\{}\backslashmathfrak{\{}s{\}}{\}}{\_}{\{}\backslashkappa{\}} \backslashleq {\{}\backslashmathfrak{\{}b{\}}{\}}{\_}{\{}\backslashkappa{\}}{\$}.},
