abstract = {For a partial order P having infinite antichains by a(P) we denote the minimal cardinality of an infinite maximal antichain in P and investigate how does this cardinal invariant of posets behave in finite products. In particular we show that min{\{}a(P), p(sqP){\}} ≤ a(P n) ≤ a(P), for all n ∈ N, where p(sqP) is the minimal size of a centered family without a lower bound in the separative quotient of the poset P, or p(sqP) = ∞, if there is no such family. So we have a(P×P) = a(P) whenever p(sqP) ≥ a(P) and we show that, in addition, this equality holds for all posets obtained from infinite Boolean algebras of size ≤ $\omega$ 1 by removing zero, all reversed trees, all atomic posets and, in particular, for all posets of the form C, ⊂⊂, where C is a family of nonempty closed sets in a compact T 1-space containing all singletons. As a by-product we obtain the following combinatorial statement: If X is an infinite set and {\{}A i × B i : i ∈ I {\}} an infinite partition of the square X 2 , then at least one of the families {\{}A i : i ∈ I {\}} and {\{}B i : i ∈ I {\}} contains an infinite partition of X.},
