abstract = {Let $\kappa$ {\textless} $\lambda$ be regular uncountable cardinals. Using a finite support iteration (in fact a matrix iteration) of ccc posets we obtain the consistency of . If $\mu$ is a measurable cardinal and $\mu$ {\textless} $\kappa$ {\textless} $\lambda$, then using similar techniques we obtain the consistency of .},
