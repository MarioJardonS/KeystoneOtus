abstract = {For a partial order ℙ having infinite antichains by a(ℙ) we denote the minimal cardinality of an infinite maximal antichain in ℙ and investigate how does this cardinal invariant of posets behave in finite products. In particular we show that min {\{} a(ℙ) , p(sq ℙ) {\}} ≤ a(ℙn) ≤ (ℙ) , for all n∈ ℕ, where p(sq ℙ) is the minimal size of a centered family without a lower bound in the separative quotient of the poset ℙ, or P(sq ℙ) = ∞, if there is no such family. So we have a(ℙ× ℙ) = a(ℙ) whenever p(sq ℙ) ≥ a(ℙ) and we show that, in addition, this equality holds for all posets obtained from infinite Boolean algebras of size ≤{\o}1 by removing zero, all reversed trees, all atomic posets and, in particular, for all posets of the form 〈 C, ⊂ 〉 , where C is a family of nonempty closed sets in a compact T1-space containing all singletons. As a by-product we obtain the following combinatorial statement: If X is an infinite set and {\{}Ai×Bi:i∈I{\}} an infinite partition of the square X2, then at least one of the families {\{}Ai :i∈I{\}} and {\{}Bi:i∈I{\}} contains an infinite partition of X.},
