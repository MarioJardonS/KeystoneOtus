abstract = {In this article we discuss the behaviour of reaping numbers under operations on Boolean algebras. Some major results are as follows. (1) If I is infinite, then r ( i I A i) = max(I, sup{\{}r (A i): i I{\}}). (2) If r (A)= r (B), then r 2 (AB)= r (A B). (3) If I is infinite then hwd(i I A i)= max{\{}I, sup{\{}hwd(A i): i I{\}}{\}}. (4) If L is a linear order with a first element, then hwd(Intalg(L))= d(L). (5) If A is the completion of an interval algebra, then hwd(A)= y(A). (6) If T is a tree with no maximal elements, then hwd(Treealg(T))= T. For the notation here, see below. 1. Definitions We use usual set theoretic notation. In particular, V2 is the set of all natural numbers greater than 1. For Boolean algebras we refer to Koppelberg [4]; for cardinal functions on Boolean algebras, to Monk [5]. For n V2, an n-partition of a BA A is a disjoint system a i : iB n of elements of A such that i B n a i = 1. We do not require that each a i is nonzero; hence each n-partition can be extended to an (n+ 1)-partition. We say that a set X¦ A is n-reaped by an n-partition a i : iB n if for all x X + the set {\{}i Bn: a i {\textperiodcentered} x"0{\}} has size greater than one. Now, for n V2, we can define r n (A) = min{\{}X: X¤A and X cannot be n-reaped by any n-partition{\}}. Also define r (A) =sup{\{}r n (A): n V2{\}}. Note that the following two conditions are equivalent: (1) X cannot be n-reaped by any n-partition; (2) If a i : iB n is an n-partition, then there exist an iB n and an x X such that x5 a i. Also note r 2 (A) 5 r 3 (A) 5 {\textperiodcentered} {\textperiodcentered} {\textperiodcentered}5r (A). Note if we have a dense set in A then this set cannot be n-reaped by any n-partition for all n V2 so r (A)5 y(A). These cardinal functions have been studied in [1] and [3]. We state some of their results without proof. Presented by R. W. Quackenbush.},
