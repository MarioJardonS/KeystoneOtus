abstract = {We study some strong combinatorial properties of MAD families. An ideal I is Shelah-Stepr¯ ans if for every set X ⊆ [$\omega$] {\textless}$\omega$ there is an element of I that either intersects every set in X or contains infinitely many members of it. We prove that a Borel ideal is Shelah-Stepr¯ ans if and only if it is Kat{\v{e}}tov above the ideal fin×fin. We prove that Shelah-Stepr¯ ans MAD families have strong indestructibility properties (in particular, they are both Cohen and random indestructible). We also consider some other strong combinatorial properties of MAD families. Finally, it is proved that it is consistent to have non(M) = ℵ 1 and no Shelah-Stepr¯ ans families of size ℵ 1 .},
