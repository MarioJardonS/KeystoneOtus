abstract = {If dominating functions in $\omega$$\omega$ are adjoined repeatedly over a model of GCH via a finite-support c.c.c. iteration, then in the resulting generic extension there are no long towers, every well-ordered unbounded family of increasing functions is a scale, and the splitting number (and hence the distributivity number ) remains at $\omega$1.},
