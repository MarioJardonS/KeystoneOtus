abstract = {A nitrogen-fixing, endospore-forming, motile, rod-shaped, facultative aerobic bacterium, designated 81-11T, was isolated from rhizosphere soil of a peach tree collected from Handan, Hebei, PR China. From the comparison of 16S rRNA gene sequence, the strain is most closely related to Paenibacillus phoenicis DSM 27463T (96.9{\%}) and Paenibacillus faecis DSM 23593T (96.7{\%}). The genome size of strain 81-11T was 4.4 Mb, comprising 4879 predicted genes with a DNA G+C content of 50.0 mol{\%}. The average nucleotide identity values of genome sequences between the novel isolate and the type strains of related species P. phoenicis DSM 27463T and P. faecis DSM 23593T were 71.8 and 72.1{\%}, respectively. The major cellular fatty acids were anteiso-C15:0 (47.8{\%}), iso-C16:0 (15.5{\%}) and iso-C15:0 (13.0{\%}). Menaquinone-7 was the major respiratory quinone. The polar lipids contained phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylglycerol, diphosphatidylglycerol, aminophospholipid, aminoglycopid, unknown polar lipids and unidentified aminophosphoglycolipid. Based on phylogenetic, genomic and phenotypic characteristics, strain 81-11T was classified as a novel species within the genus Paenibacillus, for which the name Paenibacillus caui sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain of Paenibacillus caui is 81-11T (=JCM 34618T=CGMCC 1.18907T).},
