abstract = {Available online xxxx Communicated by Slawomir Solecki MSC: 03E17 03E35 03E05 Keywords: MAD families Ultrafilters Almost disjointness number P-points ultrafilter number We prove that every MAD family can be destroyed by a proper forcing that preserves P-points. With this result, we prove that it is consistent that $\omega$ 1 = u {\textless} a, solving a nearly 20 year old problem of Shelah, and a problem of Brendle. We will also present a simple proof of a result of Blass and Shelah that the inequality u {\textless} s is consistent.},
