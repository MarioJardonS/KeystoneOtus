abstract = {Given an ideal I on $\omega$ let a(I) (¯ a(I)) be minimum of the cardinalities of innite (uncountable) maximal I-almost disjoint subsets of [$\omega$] $\omega$. We show that a(I h) {\textgreater} $\omega$ if I h is a summable ideal; but a(Z µ) = $\omega$ for any tall density ideal Z µ including the density zero ideal Z. On the other hand, you have b ≤ ¯ a(I) for any analytic P-ideal I, and ¯ a(Z µ) ≤ a for each density ideal Z µ. For each ideal I on $\omega$ denote bI and dI the unbounding and dominating numbers of $\omega$ $\omega$ , ≤I where f ≤I g i {\{}n ∈ $\omega$ : f (n) {\textgreater} g(n){\}} ∈ I. We show that bI = b and dI = d for each analytic P-ideal I. Given a Borel ideal I on $\omega$ we say that a poset P is I-bounding i ∀x ∈ I ∩ V P ∃y ∈ I ∩ V x ⊆ y. P is I-dominating i ∃y ∈ I ∩ V P ∀x ∈ I ∩ V x ⊆ * y. For each analytic P-ideal I if a poset P has the Sacks property then P is I-bounding; moreover if I is tall as well then the property I-bounding/I-dominating implies $\omega$ $\omega$-bounding/adding dominating reals, and the converses of these two implications are false. Using David Fremlin's results we prove that if P adds a slalom capturing all ground model reals then P is I-dominating for each analytic P-ideal I, and that a poset P is Z-bounding i it has the Sacks property.},
