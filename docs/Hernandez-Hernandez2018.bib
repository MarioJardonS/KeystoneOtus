abstract = {An infinite family A of infinite subsets of the natural numbers, $\omega$, is almost disjoint (AD) if the intersection of any two distinct elements of A is finite. It is maximal almost disjoint (MAD) if given an infinite X ⊂ $\omega$ there is an A $\epsilon$ A such that │ A ∩ X │ = $\omega$, in other words, if the family A is not included in any larger almost disjoint family.},
