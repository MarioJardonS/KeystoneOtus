abstract = {Zinc is an important micronutrient needed for the optimum growth and development of plants. Contrary to chemical zinc fertilizers, the use of zinc-solubilizing bacteria is an environmentally friendly option for zinc enrichment in edible parts of crops. This study was conducted with the objective of selecting potential zinc-solubilizing rhizobacteria from the rhizosphere of chickpea grown in soils of eastern Uttar Pradesh and further assessing their impact on the magnitude of zinc assimilation in wheat crops. Among 15 isolates, CRS-9, CRS-17, CRS-30, and CRS-38 produced net soluble zinc in broth to the tune of 6.1, 5.9, 5.63, and 5.6 $\mu$g ml–1, respectively, in zinc phosphate with the corresponding pH of 4.48, 5.31, 5.2, and 4.76. However, the bacterial strains CRS-17, CRS-30, CRS-38, and CRS-9 showed maximum zinc phosphate solubilization efficiency of 427.79, 317.39, 253.57, and 237.04{\%}, respectively. The four bacterial isolates were identified as Bacillus glycinifermentans CRS-9, Microbacterium oxydans CRS-17, Paenarthrobacter nicotinovorans CRS-30, and Bacillus tequilensis CRS-38 on the basis of morphological and biochemical studies and 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Bacterial inoculants significantly colonized the roots of wheat plants and formed a biofilm in the root matrix. These strains significantly increased seed germination ({\%}) and vigor indices in wheat grown under glasshouse conditions. After 30 days of sowing of wheat under microcosm conditions, eight zinc transporter (TaZIP) genes were expressed maximally in roots, with concomitant accumulation of higher zinc content in the bacterially treated plant compared to the absolute control. Out of the four strains tested, two bacteria, B. tequilensis CRS-38 and P. nicotinovorans CRS-30, improved seed germination ({\%}), vigor indices (2–2.5 folds), plant biomass, grain yield (2.39 g plant–1), and biofortificated grains (54.25 $\mu$g g–1Zn) of wheat. To the best of our knowledge, this may be the first report on the presence of zinc solubilization trait in B. glycinifermentans CRS-9, M. oxydans CRS-17, and P. nicotinovorans CRS-30.},
