abstract = {Informally, a proper forcing P is strategically bounding if there is a strategy to prove that P is {\$}\omega{\$}{\$}\omega{\$}-bounding. We prove that certain MAD families are indestructible by strategically bounding forcings. Our motivation for studying this topic is the problem of Roitman: Does d= {\$}\omega{\$}1 imply a= {\$}\omega{\$}1? From this work, it follows that a model of {\$}\omega{\$}1= d{\textless}a cannot be obtained by forcing with a strategically bounding forcing over a model of CH. We prove an iteration theorem for strategically bounding forcings.},
