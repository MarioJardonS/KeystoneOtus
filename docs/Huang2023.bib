abstract = {Rhizospheric degradation is a green and in situ strategy to accelerate dissipation of organic pollutants in soils. However, the mechanism on microbial degradation of phthalic acid esters (PAEs) in rhizosphere is still unclear. Here, the bacterial community and function genes in bulk and rhizospheric soils of maize (Zea mays L.) exposed to gradient concentrations of di-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) were analyzed with 16 S rRNA, metagenomic sequencing and quantitative PCR (qPCR). Maize rhizosphere significantly increased the dissipation of DEHP by 4.02â€“11.5{\%} in comparison with bulk soils. Bacterial community in rhizosphere exhibited more intensive response and shaped its beneficial structure and functions to DEHP stress than that in bulk soils. Both rhizospheric and pollution effects enriched more PAE-degrading bacteria (e.g., Bacillus and Rhizobium) and function genes in rhizosphere than in bulk soil, which played important roles in degradation of PAEs in rhizosphere. The PAE-degrading bacteria (including genera Sphingomonas, Sphingopyxis and Lysobacter) identified as keystone species participated in DEHP biodegradation. Identification of PAE intermediates and metagenomic reconstruction of PAE degradation pathways demonstrated that PAE-degrading bacteria degraded PAEs through cooperation with PAE-degrading and non-PAE-degrading bacteria. This study provides a comprehensive knowledge for the microbial mechanism on the superior dissipation of PAEs in rhizosphere.},
