abstract = {Given an ideal I on $\omega$ let a(I) (¯ a(I)) be minimum of the cardinalities of infinite (uncountable) maximal I-almost disjoint subsets of [$\omega$] $\omega$. We show that a(I h) {\textgreater} $\omega$ if I h is a summable ideal; but a(Z µ) = $\omega$ for any tall density ideal Z µ including the density zero ideal Z. On the other hand, you have b ≤ ¯ a(I) for any analytic P-ideal I, and ¯ a(Z µ) ≤ a for each density ideal Z µ. For each ideal I on $\omega$ denote b I and d I the unbounding and dominating numbers of $\omega$ $\omega$ , ≤ I where f ≤ I g iff {\{}n ∈ $\omega$ : f (n) {\textgreater} g(n){\}} ∈ I. We show that b I = b and d I = d for each analytic P-ideal I. Given a Borel ideal I on $\omega$ we say that a poset P is I-bounding iff ∀ x ∈ I ∩V P ∃ y ∈ I ∩ V x ⊆ y. P is I-dominating iff ∃ y ∈ I ∩ V P ∀ x ∈ I ∩ V x ⊆ * y. For each analytic P-ideal I if a poset P has the Sacks property then P is I-bounding; moreover if I is tall as well then the property I-bounding/I-dominating implies $\omega$ $\omega$-bounding/adding dominating reals, and the converses of these two implications are false. For the density zero ideal Z we can prove more: (i) a poset P is Z-bounding iff it has the Sacks property, (ii) if P adds a slalom capturing all ground model reals then P is Z-dominating.},
