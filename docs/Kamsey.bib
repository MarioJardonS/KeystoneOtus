abstract = {{This paper is primarily concerned with a special case of one of the leading problems of mathematical logic, the problem of finding a regular procedure to determine the truth or falsity of any given logical formula*. But in the course of this investigation it is necessary to use certain theorems on combinations which have an independent interest and are most conveniently set out by themselves beforehand. I. The theorems which we actually require concern finite classes only, but we shall begin with a similar theorem about infinite classes which is easier to prove and gives a simple example of the method of argument. THEOREM A. Let F be an infinite class, and fx and r positive integers ; and let all those sub-classes of T which have exactly r members, or, as ice may say, let all r-combinations of the members of T be divided in any manner into /* mutually exclusive classes C f (i = l, 2, ..., /x), so that every r-combination is a member of one and only one C{\textless}; then, assuming the axiom of selections, T must contain an infinite sub-class A such that all the r-combinations of the members of A belong to the same C ;-. Consider first the case /x = 2. (If p. = 1 there is nothing to prove.) The theorem is trivial when r is 1, and we prove it for all values of r by induction. Let us assume it, therefore, when r = p-1 and deduce it for r = p, there being, since /x = 2, only two classes C i{\}} namely Ci and C,.},
