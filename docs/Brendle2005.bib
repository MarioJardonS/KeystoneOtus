abstract = {Let A ⊆ [$\omega$]$\omega$ be a maximal almost disjoint family and assume ℙ is a forcing notion. Say A is ℙ-indestructible if A is still maximal in any ℙ-generic extension. We investigate ℙ-indestructibility for several classical forcing notions ℙ. In particular, we provide a combinatorial characterization of ℙ-indestructibility and, assuming a fragment of MA, we construct maximal almost disjoint families which are ℙ-indestructible yet ℚ-destructible for several pairs of forcing notions (ℙ, ℚ). We close with a detailed investigation of iterated Sacks indestructibility. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},
