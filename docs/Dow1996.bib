abstract = {A subset script A sign of a Boolean algebra double-struck B is said to be (n,m)-reaped if there is a partition of unity script P sign ⊂ double-struck B of size n such that $\backslash${\{}b∈script P sign:b ∧ a ≠ 0{\}}| ≥ m for all a ∈ script A sign. The reaping number r n,m (double-struck B) of a Boolean algebra double-struck B is the minimum cardinality of a set script A sign ⊂ double-struck B $\backslash$ {\{}0{\}} which cannot be (n,m)-reaped. It is shown that for each n ∈ $\omega$ there is a Boolean algebra double-struck B such that rn+1,2(double-struck B) ≠ r n,2 (double-struck B). Also, {\{}r n,m(double-struck B)m ≤ n∈$\omega${\}} consist of at most two consecutive cardinals. The existence of a Boolean algebra double-struck B such that rn,m(B) ≠ rn',m'(double-struck B) is equivalent to a statement in finite combinatorics which is also discussed.},
