abstract = {We generalize the cardinal invariant a to products of P($\omega$)/ fin and then sharpen the well-known inequality b ≤ a by proving b ≤ a($\lambda$) for every $\lambda$ ≤ $\omega$. Here a(n), for n {\textless} $\omega$y is the least size of an infinite partition of (P($\omega$)/fin)n, a($\omega$) is the least size of an uncountable partition of (P(w)/fin)$\omega$, and b is the least size of an unbounded family of functions from $\omega$ to $\omega$ ordered by eventual dominance. We also prove the consistency of b {\textless} a(n) for every n {\textless} $\omega$.},
