abstract = {We develop a version of Cicho{\'{n}}'s diagram for cardinal invariants on the generalized Cantor space 2$\kappa$ or the generalized Baire space $\kappa$$\kappa$, where $\kappa$ is an uncountable regular cardinal. For strongly inaccessible $\kappa$, many of the ZFC-results about the order relationship of the cardinal invariants which hold for $\omega$ generalize; for example, we obtain a natural generalization of the Bartoszy{\'{n}}ski–Raisonnier–Stern Theorem. We also prove a number of independence results, both with {\textless} $\kappa$-support iterations and $\kappa$-support iterations and products, showing that we consistently have strict inequality between some of the cardinal invariants.},
