For every Boolean algebra B the minimal n-character of an ultrafilter on B is at most 2", where r, is the reaping number of B. An example of B is given for which r*(B) {\textless} min{\{}q(U): U E W(B){\}}. For an integer k 2 2 define a kth reaping number of a Boolean algebra B to be rk(B) = min{\{}]X]: X c B {\&} (V partition P of 1 with IPI d k) (3p E P)(3x E X)0 {\textless}x cp{\}}. r*(B) is called a refinement number by Vaughan [7], a reaping number by Goldstern and Shelah [5] and a weak density by Bozeman [l] and Burke [4]. The present authors have studied the relations between r,, n-character of ultrafilters on B and the density n(B) of B in [2]. One can see immediately from the definitions that {\~{}}(8) d r3(B) s. .. s q(B) s n(B) In our previous paper we have shown that r*(B) = min{\{}xx(L/): U E Ult(B){\}} provided that the Boolean algebra in question is either homogeneous or complete. Our aim now is to prove that the above inequality can be sharp, i.e., to find a Boolean algebra B with r*(B) {\textless} r3(B) and to show that the gap between r, and nx cannot be too large. The notation used in the paper is the standard one. The Boolean operations will be denoted by v (join) and A (meet). Ult(B) denotes the Stone space of a},
