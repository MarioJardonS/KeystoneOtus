abstract = {A family T of infinite subsets of $\omega$ is called almost disjoint if for every distinct F, G$\epsilon${\{}lunate{\}}T the set F∩G is finite, and a family T={\{}T$\beta$|$\beta$$\epsilon${\{}lunate{\}}$\alpha${\}} of such infinite subsets is called a tower if $\delta${\textless}$\gamma${\textless}$\alpha$ implies that T$\gamma${\{}minus 45 degree rule{\}}T$\delta$ is finite but T$\delta${\{}minus 45 degree rule{\}}T$\gamma$ is infinite. A tower T is called complete if there exists no infinite set U⊆$\omega$ such that for every T$\epsilon${\{}lunate{\}}T the set U{\{}minus 45 degree rule{\}}T is finite. In this paper we prove that each of the following statements is consistent with the axioms of Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory including the Axiom of Choice and the negation of the Continuum Hypothesis: (1). Every maximal almost-disjoint family and every complete tower has cardinality 2אο. (2). For every cardinal $\lambda$ such that אo{\textless}$\lambda$≤2אο there exists a maximal almost-disjoint family of cardinality $\lambda$, and for every ordinal $\alpha$ such that $\omega${\textless}cf$\alpha$≤$\alpha$≤2אο there exists a complete tower T={\{}T$\beta$|$\beta${\textless}$\alpha${\}}. These results are then applied to $\beta$N{\{}minus 45 degree rule{\}}N using the well known correspondence between subsets of $\omega$ module finite subsets and clopen subsets of $\beta$N{\{}minus 45 degree rule{\}}N. Thus almost-disjoint families correspond to disjoint clopen families, and towers to nested clopen families. {\textcopyright} 1972.},
