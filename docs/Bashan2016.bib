abstract = {Human-associated microbial communities have a crucial role in determining our health and well-being 1,2 , and this has led to the continuing development of microbiome-based therapies 3 such as faecal microbiota transplantation 4,5. These microbial communities are very complex, dynamic 6 and highly personalized ecosystems 3,7 , exhibiting a high degree of inter-individual variability in both species assemblages 8 and abundance profiles 9. It is not known whether the underlying ecological dynamics of these communities, which can be parameterized by growth rates, and intra-and inter-species interactions in population dynamics models 10 , are largely host-independent (that is, universal) or host-specific. If the inter-individual variability reflects host-specific dynamics due to differences in host lifestyle 11 , physiology 12 or genetics 13 , then generic microbiome manipulations may have unintended consequences, rendering them ineffective or even detrimental. Alternatively, microbial ecosystems of different subjects may exhibit universal dynamics, with the inter-individual variability mainly originating from differences in the sets of colonizing species 7,14. Here we develop a new computational method to characterize human microbial dynamics. By applying this method to cross-sectional data from two large-scale metagenomic studies-the Human Microbiome Project 9,15 and the Student Microbiome Project 16-we show that gut and mouth microbiomes display pronounced universal dynamics, whereas communities associated with certain skin sites are probably shaped by differences in the host environment. Notably, the universality of gut microbial dynamics is not observed in subjects with recurrent Clostridium difficile infection 17 but is observed in the same set of subjects after faecal microbiota transplantation. These results fundamentally improve our understanding of the processes that shape human microbial ecosystems, and pave the way to designing general microbiome-based therapies 18. The underlying dynamics of a microbial ecosystem, that is, the ecological interactions that govern its change, equilibrium and stability, can be represented by a population dynamic model $\Theta$ = () () $\nu$ $\nu$ $\nu$ () () () x f x ; 1 which describes the time-dependent abundance profile ()= (() {\ldots} ()) $\nu$ $\nu$ $\nu$ () () () x t x t x t , , N 1 of N microbial species present in a particular body site of subject $\nu$. Here, $\Theta$ () $\nu$ $\nu$ () () x f ; is typically a nonlinear function and $\Theta$ $\nu$ () captures all the ecological parameters, that is, growth rates, and intra-and inter-species interactions. Those parameters may generally depend on host-independent factors, such as biochemical processes and microbial metabolic pathways 19 ; and on host-specific ones, such as nutrient intake 20 and host genetic make-up 13. Three fundamental cases could represent the dynamics of M healthy subjects: (1) individual dynamics, in which the ecological parameters are different in different subjects, that is, $\Theta$ $\Theta$ ≠ ≠ () () M 1 ; (2) group dynamics, in which subjects can be classified into K groups (K M) on the basis of certain host factors and subjects in the same group share the same set of parameters, that is, $\Theta$ $\Theta$ = $\nu$ () P for all subjects in group P (P = 1, ..., K); and (3) universal dynamics, in which all the subjects share the same set of parameters, that is, $\Theta$ $\Theta$ = $\nu$ () for all subjects. If we represent the ecological parameters, such as the inter-species interactions, in a directed, weighted ecological network, the above three cases can be easily visualized (see Fig. 1). Despite its crucial consequences, we do not know which case best represents the microbial ecosystems of healthy individuals. Addressing this question is vital for developing microbiome-based therapies 3,18. Indeed, if the dynamics are universal, the inter-personal variability stems solely from the different assemblages of colonizing species in different individuals. We can then design Figure 1 | Alternative scenarios of microbial dynamics across different healthy subjects. Microbial dynamics captured by equation (1) is simply represented by an ecological network, in which nodes represent species (with node sizes proportional to growth rates) and edges represent inter-species interactions (with green and red arrows representing excitatory and inhibitory interactions, respectively). Different subjects typically have different species assemblages, represented by coloured circles near each subject. a, The underlying dynamics/network is unique for each subject. b, Subjects within the same group share the same dynamics/network that is significantly different from that of other groups. c, Different subjects have the same underlying dynamics/network.},
