abstract = {We prove some consistency results about b($\lambda$) and $\delta$($\lambda$), which are natural generalisations of the cardinal invariants of the continuum b and d. We also define invariants bcl($\lambda$) and $\delta$cl($\lambda$), and prove that almost always b($\lambda$) = bcl($\lambda$) and d($\lambda$) = dcl($\lambda$). {\textcopyright} 1995.},
