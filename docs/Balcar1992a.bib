abstract = {For every Boolean algebra B the minimal {\$}\pi{\$}-character of an ultrafilter on B is at most 2r2, where r2 is the reaping number of B. An example of B is given for which r2(B){\textless}min{\{}{\$}\pi{\$}{\$}\chi{\$}(U): U {\$}\epsilon{\$}{\{}lunate{\}} Ult(B){\}}. {\textcopyright}1992.},
